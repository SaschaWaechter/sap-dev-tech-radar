# Frequently Asked Questions

## You do it wrong

No.

## You use the wrong names for the rings

No.

## Do it like Throughtworks tech radar

No.

## Why not?

The SAP development tech radar is based on Thoughtworks tech radar, but only based on it. It takes some inspiration from it, like quadrants and rings. The SDTR is not to compare products. It is not to help you navigate the wide range of products for the same use case.

## Can the SAP development tech radar used for SAP ERP products?

No.

## And why not?

Listing ERP products like S/4HANA, SAP Analytics Cloud, BNAC, EPD, AM, SuccessFactors, Ariba, or modules like MM, CO, FI won't work. Selecting these kind of products is the task of enterprise architecture. Products are selected via their capabilities. The business process of a customer are analyzed, their capabilities identified and matched with the capabilities of SAP products. As the matching depends on the business process demanded capabilities, this is highly dependent on the business process. While companies might use the same process, how it is used results in different capabilities. Thus, a solution that works for company A won't necessarily work for company B. This is why a tech radar like the SDTR won't work.

## Why focus on SAP and not 3rd party products?

The SDTR aims to show SAP developers how their tech stack is listed compared to the recommendation. It aims to list technologies that every SAP developer - in theory - has access to, or easily could have.
